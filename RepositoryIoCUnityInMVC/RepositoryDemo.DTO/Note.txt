1. In case you need to convert your model to data model or view model to data model, this project will do the same.
2. You can use automapper instead, but always recommend to use DTO to have your solution to address non-solvable issues by automapper.
3. This project will reference to 'RepositoryDemo.Data' as well as 'RepositoryDemo.Model' projects to convert model to data model.
4. Create a new class inside this project only when you need. Not necessarly always.

Note: I have seen devs using DTO as model or view model, so how you use DTO is up to you. 
But if you look into really large project, they use DTO to convert data from one model to another model format.
